<h2> Description <h2>

<h3> Welcome to Brewery Buddy 2.0! This is a full stack single page application intended for users to journal their favorite breweries as well as their favorites beers. The app was built using JavaScript for the frontend and Ruby on Rails for the backend.</h3> 

<h2> Getting started </h2>

-- You can find Brewery Buddy 2.0 in the github repository @ https://github.com/Ariel-I/Brewery-Buddy-2.0 --

In order to properly run the program you must clone the github repository from git@github.com:Ariel-I/Brewery-Buddy-2.0.git. After cloning the repo be sure your terminal is in the right file by typing ```cd Brewery-Buddy-2.0``` and hitting enter. 

Then move into the backend files using  ```cd backend```  and run ```bundle install```

After the gems are installed run the program by running ```rails s``` in the terminal and open the index.html file in the browser.

<h2> How to </h2>

After routing to the index.html file in the browser, Brewery Buddy 2.0 will be ready to go! The user has the ability to view breweries that have already been created as well as add and delete breweries. The user can also add and delete items to each brewery as they go. 

Cheers!
